					<h4>My First Job as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>3 months after writing my first Hello World program on September 8th 2012 (While Studying in Centre Point School ,Nagpur) Thats when I realized that computers are the coolest things in the world . There are some little people who are really able to work for there passion, and I sure do appreciate the opportunity that has been given to me.</p>

					<p>I find web development to be a sector where a person can use both creativity and logic . I started by making a static website for a startup, now responsible for making my official institute alumni portal.</p>

					<p>From this you‚Äôll see that I‚Äôm someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>Reverse Engineer & Build Ugly Prototypes First.</p>

					<p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece. I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation is just a reference.</p>
